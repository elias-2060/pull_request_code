Programming Errors:
    Undefined Attributes and Methods:

        In Facility:
            - the self.type is accessed in the __init__ method before being initialized for the assert. This will raise an AttributeError.
            - The get_type() method lacks the self parameter, making it unusable.
            - get_special_facilities in special_facilities.py assumes user.facilities[0] exists, which could cause an IndexError if the list is empty.
            - In get_facility_name, EnumSpecialFacilties.GROOTLETTERTYPE is used, but the correct enum name appears to be GROOT_LETTERTYPE.

        Invalid User Initialization:
            - circular import in user.py because we import usermanager and but this is already imported in special_facilities.py
              wich we also imported.

        Missing Implementations:
            - SignupForm lacks implementations for its methods, such as fill(). This leaves key functionality unimplemented.

Security Problems:
    Input Validation and Sanitization:
        - Thereâ€™s no validation or sanitization of user inputs in SignupForm. This can lead to injection attacks or invalid data being processed.

    Authorization Checks:
        - There's no check to ensure only admins can access or modify facilities. get_special_facilities and Facility management functionality are not restricted to admin users.

    Improper Use of Assertions:
        - Assertions (e.g., in User and Facility) are used for critical runtime checks. These should be replaced with proper error handling as assertions can be disabled in production.

Missing or Incorrect Features:
    Facilities Database Integration:
        - Facilities are defined as an Enum, but the requirements specify that they should be stored in a database for easy addition and removal. A database model is missing.

    Admin-Only Operations:
        - Admin-only constraints are not enforced programmatically.

    Facilities Association with Users:
        - The Student class associates facilities with students, but methods to add or remove facilities dynamically are absent.

    Facility Retrieval:
        - get_special_facilities should return all facilities for a user, but it only retrieves the first facility in the list.

Software Engineering Issues:
    Cohesion and Clarity:
        - The Facility class is underdeveloped. For example, __str__() returns None instead of a meaningful string representation.

    Use of Hardcoded Logic:
        - get_facility_name uses a match statement wich is hardcoded logic. This violates the requirement to make adding/removing facilities easier via a database.

    OOP Best Practices:
        - The Student and Admin constructors use the base User constructor but introduce unnecessary complexity by requiring another User object as input.

    Unused or Unnecessary Imports:
        - math is imported but unused in special_facilities.py.
